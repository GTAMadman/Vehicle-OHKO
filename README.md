# Vehicle OHKO

Vehicle OHKO is a challenge mod for GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas which destroys your vehicle upon taking any damage.

## How It Works

Vehicle OHKO only applies to the player's current vehicle if they are the driver (being a passenger does not apply).
Upon taking any damage, the player vehicle will set on fire.

*All missions for each game have been tested and can be completed with this mod.*

## Supported Versions

* GTA 3 - v1.0 - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/681997064288469090/682718874306740252/gta3.exe
* GTA Vice City - v1.0 - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/681997098153148433/682719019052040229/gta-vc.exe
* GTA San Andreas - v1.00 - https://dl1.rockstarnexus.com/gta/sa/GTASA_12-9-14_Steam_to_V1_DG.exe

GTA San Andreas requires an ASI Loader to be installed. [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) by [ThirteenAG](https://github.com/ThirteenAG) is a popular and easy to use option.
To install the Ultimate ASI Loader, simply extract the Ultimate ASI Loader's dinput8.dll file to the game's root directory (folder where the game is installed).

Other versions of the game *will not* work and will most likely cause a crash.

## Installation

1) Downgrade to 1.0 (download link's available above)
2) Download the latest version from the releases page: https://github.com/GTAMadman/Vehicle-OHKO/releases
3) Put the ASI file in the appropriate GTA directory (ASI Loader required for San Andreas).
